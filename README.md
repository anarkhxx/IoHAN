# IoHAN
   IoHAN, an interpretable outcome prediction model by leveraging attention mechanism. The main novelty of IoHAN is that it can pinpoint the fine-grained influence on the final
prediction result of each medical component by decomposing the attention weights hierarchically into hospital visits, medical variables, and interactions between medical variables. We evaluated IoHAN on MIMIC-III, a large real-world EHR dataset. The experiment results demonstrate that IoHAN can achieve higher prediction accuracy than state-ofthe-art outcome prediction models. In addition, the hierarchical decomposed attention weights can interpret the prediction results in a more natural and understandable way.
